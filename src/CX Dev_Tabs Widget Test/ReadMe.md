# Atos CX - Tabbed Interface Test 

## Instructions

Build a simple tabbed interface whereby users can select one of three tabs and view the associated content (see structure below). It should run in any modern browser.

The tabs appear at the side of the page (see tabs-horizontal.png) on screens 768px or larger and at the top (see tabs-vertical.png) on smaller ones. The page content should have a max width of 1024px and be centered. All content should be fluid, but please use any proportions you like.  

Use any major front end framework (React, Angular, Vue), boilerpolate or accelerator (e.g. Create React App) you like and use any theme or custom styling you like. The Typeface should be [Roboto Regular](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Roboto)

Please do not spend more than two hours on the test. If the solution is not complete by the end of that time please explain what you did in your notes.
