        "body": "Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 refer to eras in the history of the World Wide Web as it evolved through various technologies and formats. Web 1.0 refers roughly to the period from 1991 to 2004, where most websites were static webpages, and the vast majority of users were consumers, not producers, of content.[7][8] Web 2.0 is based around the idea of \"the web as platform\" and centers on user-created content uploaded to social media and networking services, blogs, and wikis, among other services. Web 2.0 is generally considered to have begun around 2004 and continues to the current day."

        "body": "The term \"Web3\", specifically, \"Web 3.0\", was coined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014. In 2021, the idea of Web3 gained popularity.[12] Particular interest spiked toward the end of 2021, largely due to interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investments from high-profile technologists and companies. Executives from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz traveled to Washington, D.C. in October 2021 to lobby for the idea as a potential solution to questions about regulation of the web, with which policymakers have been grappling."

        "body": "Specific visions for Web3 differ, and the term has been described by Bloomberg as \"hazy\", but they revolve around the idea of decentralization and often incorporate blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Bloomberg has described Web3 as an idea that \"would build financial assets, in the form of tokens, into the inner workings of almost anything you do online\". Some visions are based around the concepts of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)."
